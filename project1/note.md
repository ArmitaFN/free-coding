# Goal:
A script that checks if a password is strong enough and gives suggestion
# Uses: 
cybersecurity, coding, Github flow
# Tips:
logic, conditionals, funstions
# Brain storming:
well, first i need to get an input for sure
then i should see if it's more than 6 letters
then see if there is both letter and number
if it only contains one of them and 6 place holder, then we say its low security
if it contains only one of them but have 7 to 9 placeholder, then we say its mid
if it contains only one of them but more than 9 place holder, then its strong
if it contains both letter and number and 6 place holder, we still say its mid
if it contains both letter and number with 7 to 9 placeholder, we say its strong
if it contains both letter and number more than 9, its very strong
if it was low security, we suggest first half part of the letters be repeated at the end of it
there should also be a limit, we set it to 15 letters
