# Goal:
A script that checks if a password is strong enough and gives suggestion
# Uses: 
cybersecurity, coding, Github flow
# Tips:
logic, conditionals, funstions
# Brain storming:
I:  
First I need to get an input  
II:  
I also need to set the conditions (upper/lower case, numbers, symbols)  
III:  
Set the min and max clear  
IV:  
check the number of characters  
min = 4, MAX = 12  
n is the characters number  
4 <= n < 6 is weak, 6 <= n < 8 is medium, 8 <= n is strong  
V:  
If it was accepted but low security, we suggest first half part of the letters be repeated at the end of it
