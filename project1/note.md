# Goal:
A script that checks if a password is strong enough and gives suggestion
# Uses: 
cybersecurity, coding, Github flow
# Tips:
logic, conditionals, funstions
# Brain storming:
I:  
first i need to get an input for sure  
II:  
then i should see if it's more than 6 letters  
III:  
then see if there is both letter and number  
if it only contains one of them and 6 place holder, then we say its low security  
if it contains only one of them but have 7 to 9 placeholder, then we say its mid  
if it contains only one of them but more than 9 place holder, then its strong  
if it contains both letter and number and 6 place holder, we still say its mid  
if it contains both letter and number with 7 to 9 placeholder, we say its strong  
if it contains both letter and number more than 9, its very strong  
IV:  
if it was low security, we suggest first half part of the letters be repeated at the end of it  
V:  
there should also be a limit, we set it to 15 letters
