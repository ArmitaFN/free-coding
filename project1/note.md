# Goal:
A script that checks if a password is strong enough and gives suggestion
# Uses: 
cybersecurity, coding, Github flow
# Tips:
logic, conditionals, funstions
# Brain storming:
I:  
First I need to get an input  
II:  
Then I should see if it's more than 6 letters  
III:  
Then see if there is both letter and number  
if it only contains one of them and length of 6, then we say its low security  
if it contains only one of them but have 7 to 9, then we say its mid  
if it contains only one of them but more than 9, then its strong  
if it contains both letter and number and 6, we still say its mid  
if it contains both letter and number with 7 to 9, we say its strong  
if it contains both letter and number more than 9, its very strong  
IV:  
If it was low security, we suggest first half part of the letters be repeated at the end of it  
V:  
There should also be a limit, we set it to 15 letters
